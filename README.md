# AR-Luft

In the context of this work, a prototypical application was created that visualizes the Berlin air quality data retrieved from the Berlin Air Quality
Monitoring Network (Berliner Luftg√ºte-Messnetzes, BLUME) using augmented reality. The goal was to introduce the younger generation to BLUME as an organization and its tasks. The prototype developed, AR-Luft, is aimed at young people between 10 and 15 years of age and is to be used as support for class trips or theme days.

AR-Luft contains three views: a 2D map view and two visualizations in AR. In the map view, the locations of the BLUME measuring stations are displayed. A list of pollutants measured there is displayed by selecting a station from which one can pick a station. There begins the first AR experience, which aims to collect pollutant particles. Finally, the temporal development of the pollutant measurements of all measuring stations is displayed in a 3D graph. Both AR views were created using the Rest API of BLUME.
